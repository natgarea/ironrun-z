# IronRun-Z
Endless running side-scroll game in which a zombie horde follows right after you, ready to eat your brain. While you try to escape you will have to avoid the “obstacles” in your way. If you fail to avoid them or stand still for too long, the zombies will catch up to you. Good luck!

# About building the game
In this section, I discuss some aspects about the development process of my first project at Ironhack.
## Biggest challenge building the game
## Possible improvements for the game
* Instead of making the player die on collision, everytime the player slips, I would let the zombies attack, then take some of its health points and let it continue running. After several zombie attacks, when the player has health points <= 0 it would die.
## Proudest moment building the game
## If I started again...
