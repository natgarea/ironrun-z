# IronRun-Z
Endless running side-scroll game in which a zombie horde follows right after you, ready to eat your brain. While you try to escape you will have to avoid the “obstacles” in your way. If you fail to avoid them or stand still for too long, the zombies will catch up to you. Good luck!
## Game Controls
* **Space bar**: jump over obstacles.
* **Esc**: pause the game.
* **Enter**: continue playing after a pause.
* **S**: start the game again after game over.
